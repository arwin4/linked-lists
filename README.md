Implementation of the Linked List assignment of The Odin Project. Includes the *Extra Credit* assignments. Please see [the lesson page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-linked-lists) or the linkedList module to see the available methods for linked lists.

This is my first project were I've used JavaScript's classes. I'd only used factories before this. This project, by its nature, uses very rigidly defined objects,  so I found the class syntax very clean to work with here.

It was fun to figure out how to re-use some methods (like `at(index)`) in other methods without sacrificing efficiency.
